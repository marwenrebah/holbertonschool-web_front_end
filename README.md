## HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

HTML serves as the backbone of web content, providing the structure and semantics that define your web pages. With HTML, you can create a structured document that includes headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and links. You'll learn how to:

- Create the basic structure of an HTML document.
- Use HTML elements to format text, add images, and create links.
- Understand the Document Object Model (DOM) and how it represents web page structure.

## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS empowers you to control the visual presentation of your web pages. It's the magic that transforms a plain HTML document into a beautifully designed website. You'll learn how to:

- Apply styles to HTML elements, including fonts, colors, and spacing.
- Work with selectors, classes, and IDs to target specific elements for styling.
- Create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
